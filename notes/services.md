#Mentoring

##Team training
- like classes?

##Personal Training ...

- Definitely list your years in dev
- Teaching you how to teach yourself
- Time Management and Working Efficiently

##BeatBootcamps | Learn the vital skills that bootcamps skip!
While coding bootcamps are very popular among upcoming developers they dont prepare you for working in an agency. 
- they skip over important info
- they "teach the test" (what recruiters will ask you)
- low job retention
- they make you memorize not understand the code
